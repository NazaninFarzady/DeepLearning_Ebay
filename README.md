# DeepLearning_Ebay
The main goal of project: Follow in the steps of Ebay and build an app that removes the background from product image
The sub-goal is to train model for changing the background of image

## Dataset
We consider using a subset of Coco dataset which is a popular large dataset in Image processing

## Models
We choosed some models to train in order to meet our goals including:
1. Tiramisu
2. Unet
3. DenseNet
4. DeepLab v3
5. Pytorch

After training and testing the models with dataset, we will do benchmarking and compair the models performance

## Web Interface
At the end we will provide a web application interface in order to able user for entering image, choosing from the models and select remove/change the background of the image
